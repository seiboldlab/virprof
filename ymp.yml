# Configure projects
projects:
  # Sample data sheets should be CSV or TSV with 4 columns:
  #
  # - A column "unit" (name unimportant) that is unique for each row
  # and identifies each sequenced units. That is, unique names for
  # technical replicates.
  # - A column "sample" (name relevant!) that lists the name of each
  #   biological sample.
  # - One column each for the forward and reverse read files. If the
  #   paths are relative, they are interpreted as relative to the
  #   location of the sample sheet. (I.e., no path if you put the
  #   sample sheet in the same folder as your read data files).
